            <h3>Elective courses and packages</h3>
            <p>In the Bachelor College you have plenty of scope to put your own study program together, based on your personal interests and ambitions. You may choose to specialize by studying a field in more depth, or to build up a wider profile by combining several fields. Another option would be to take on the challenge of an honors program or pursue a second-level teaching qualification for secondary education. You will arrange your own study program by choosing a USE learning trajectory (15 ECTS) that suits you and 45 ECTS of elective courses.*<br><br>
            You can opt for coherent elective packages or separate elective courses. In principle, any course in the Bachelor College can be chosen as an elective, including major courses from other programs.  You may also follow more than one USE learning trajectory. This option will be regarded as a coherent elective package of 15 ECTS. The <a href="https://osiris.tue.nl/osiris_student_tueprd/OnderwijsCatalogusSelect.do?selectie=cursus&cursustype=bc&collegejaar=2016" target="_blank">course catalog</a> – <a href="https://mytue.tue.nl" target="_blank">https://mytue.tue.nl</a> – contains the range of courses that will be offered this academic year.<br><br>
            In your choice, however, you will need to take into account the necessary prior knowledge required for the course and the time slot you wish to choose. The course catalog, the <a href="https://planapp.tue.nl/" target="_blank">PLanapp</a> and this website can provide useful guidance. Discuss your choices with your <a href="https://educationguide.tue.nl/programs/bachelor-college/majors/software-science/coaching/" target="_blank">study coach</a>, who can help you make an appropriate choice. In addition, an annual <a href="https://educationguide.tue.nl/opleidingen/bachelor-college/coaching/check-your-match/" target="_blank">Check your Match</a>Check your Match event is organized, where you can explore your electives and USE learning trajectories.<br><br>
            Note that you are not allowed to choose any elective. Some electives are excluded because you will already follow that course during your study. <a href="https://static.studiegids.tue.nl/fileadmin/content/centrale_content/Bachelor_College/Vrije_Keuzeruimte/Overlapvakken_softscience_aug2016.pdf" targer="_blank">Here</a> you can find a list of all excluded courses.<br><br>                                    
            * This differs for the combined majors:<br>
            - Industrial and Applied Mathematics-Software Science: 10 ECTS electives &amp; 15 ECTS USE learning trajectory<br>
            - Web Science-Software Science 20 ECTS electives &amp; 15 ECTS USE learning trajectory<br>
            - Industrial and Applied Mathematics-Physics: 10 ECTS electives &amp; 15 ECTS USE learning trajectory<br><br>
            Tip: Use the two elective courses in the first year to obtain an orientation to your interests and the manner in which you would like to arrange the elective courses in the second and third years. Most coherent elective <a href="https://educationguide.tue.nl/opleidingen/bachelor-college/vrije-keuzeruimte/a-z-keuzepakketten/" target="_blank">packages</a> are spread over the second and third years. For several elective packages, we advise you to start by taking courses in the first year that will allow you to complete the study program within three years.<br><br>
            Tip: If you would like to take an MSc program after your Bachelor College, consult the national transfer matrix. If your major does not provide direct admission to a specific Master’s program, it could be useful to include the required homologation courses (i.e. courses that improve the connection between Bachelor’s and Master’s programs) in your electives. Always consult with the academic advisor for the relevant Master's program to learn whether supplementary courses will be necessary.</p>
