            <h3>Free stream</h3>
            <p>The streams have been set up such that they provide a structured set of courses related to important topics in computer science. The “free stream” enables you to follow a different program. In any case you have to take the CSE mandatory course together with the four mandatory courses from one of the predefined streams (Software Science, Web Science or Systems Science) but then take a set of electives that does not contain 20 EC from the stream electives of that stream. You have to ask permission to the Examinations Committee, and motivate why you cannot set up a desired individual study program that falls within one of the streams.<br>
            A commonly accepted reason for choosing the free stream is to follow a teacher-training program with courses and other credits from the Eindhoven School of Education (ESoE) aimed at obtaining a teaching degree (with or without going for a double degree). Instead of 20 EC in stream electives plus 40 EC in free electives you then take only 15 EC in electives from your chosen stream plus 45 EC as teacher training program.</p>
