            <h1>Major Computer Science &amp; Engineering</h1>
            <h3>Final Bachelor Project</h3>
            <h4>2IPE0 Software/Web Engineering Project</h4>
            <p>The knowledge and skills learned in the previous years will be applied in an integrated way in the final DBL project, a large and complex software engineering project.<br><br>
            By conducting this project you demonstrate your ability to develop large non-trivial software in a group context. Each project has a real-life external customer, who needs a software system/prototype that has to be developed. As such, the project eminently fits the learning outcomes related to Software design.
            In order to get permission to take part, you need to have:<br>
            - at least 120 ECTS six weeks before the start of the project, and<br>
            - passed the 2IPD0 or 2IP25 Software engineering course<br><br>
            A project group consists of approximately 8 students. They work almost full-time on the project. Every group has its own project room in preferably MetaForum.
            Each group has a project manager and a quality manager (Master students that follow 2IP45). Furthermore, each group has a technical advisor (staff member) to assist with technical questions and to review the technical documents.<br>
            The responsible teachers and the technical advisors judge the delivered documents and software of the group with regard to specific criteria that are published on the SEP study guide (see the course information for 2IPE0). This results in a group grade.<br>
            During the execution, peer assessment takes place in order to signal and deal with ‘freeriding’. The final peer assessments can influence the individual grade.<br><br>
            You also have to carry out a portfolio assignment on your own: you will reflect via a number of small individual exercises on the software engineering project and the Bachelor phase. This addresses professional skills like reflecting, and the ability to impart solutions to a lay public. You will also pitch yourself adressing to a panel of recruiters. The portfolio assignment is assessed separately. In order to pass the SEP component the portfolio needs to be graded as ’sufficient’.<br><br>
            In order to facilitate students who face a delay in their study progress, the project is also scheduled in Quarter 1, next to the regular instance in Quarter 4.</p>
