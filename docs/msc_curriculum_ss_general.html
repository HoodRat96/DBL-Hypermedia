            <h3>Systems Science stream</h3>
            <p>High-tech systems are defined by a tight interaction between physical systems and computing systems. They are often called “Cyber-Physical Systems”. They are characterized by complex architectures and complex interactions between physical sensors and actuators control, computation, and communication. In the CSE stream Systems Science you study these new technologies and the process to develop them. Protocols, interfaces and algorithms need to be designed to improve (energy) efficiency and automation. Larger systems are never built from scratch anymore, but composed from existing building blocks. An understanding of the essential structures and behaviors of a system - the architecture, laid down in models - is therefore essential. Models are further used to validate often using mathematically based methods and monitor required qualities (reliability, robustness, safety, security and privacy), and to drive the implementation. Experimentation and on- line methods (like self-monitoring) are essential ingredients. As a student graduating in the stream Systems Science you</p>
