            <h3>Intership and Exchange</h3>
            <h4>Intership</h4>
            <p>An internship of 15 ECTS can be included the “Free electives” part of the master program. The goal of an Internship is that the student gains experience in the future work field and can be carried out in academia or on in the industry, in the Netherlands or abroad. The Internship can also be a start-up of the Final Project; the combination Internship - Final Project is a total of 45 ECTS, but each part should be concluded and evaluated independently.<br>
            The decision concerning the Internship (to so it or not, where, in which form) should be taken in agreement with the future supervisor of the Final Project.<br>
            General rules are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>an internship gives some opportunity to compare the current study environment with the outside world, so it is done externally</li>
                <li>an internship is part of the electives and therefore it should fit in the study program and it should contribute to the learning outcomes of the Master’s degree program</li>
                <li>an internship should meet academic criteria so it is to be supervised by a staff member</li>
                <li>the study load is 15 ects, corresponding to ca 420 hours of study</li>
                <li>approval for an internship is asked in advance via both</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>a form that is to be handed in finally with the student administration and</li>
                    <li>a request stating what is to be accomplished in that internship and why it contributes to your study program.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>Students who do not have a degree or certificate(s) for at least 15 ects obtained from an organization in another country can use an internship abroad to gain some international experience.<br>
            An internship that is additional to the master program (15 ects on top of the standard 120) is allowed and will be mentioned on your "list" if it meets all other internship requirements.<br>
            Such an internship can also serve as the professional development component of the Honors Academy.</p>
            <h4>Exchange</h4>
            <p>Students who have no (or not sufficient) international experience are encouraged to obtain the international experience worth at least 15 ECTS. The international experience can be obtained through courses, research or industrial internships.<br>
            While depends on the master program you follow, prescribed homologation courses (if applicable) as well as the availability of the local supervisor and a supervisor/contact person at the host institution. Under regular circumstances, the first quartile of the second year might be the most appropriate. For an internship, starting in the summer is most appropriate because then your internship will end before the start of the second quartile.<br>
            International exchange will give the students the possibility to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get experience in working outside the home-university, learning about how international organizations work;</li>
                <li>Interact with and understanding different cultures, languages, habits;</li>
                <li>Start an international network including young, and highly educated colleagues abroad.</li>
            </ul>
