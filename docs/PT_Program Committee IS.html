            <h4>The Program Committee (PC) gives advice on:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The education program</li>
                <li>The education and exam regulations</li>
                <li>All matters concering education, also in connection with the research of the faculty</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>In addition:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The PC yearly judges the way the Education and Examination Regulation (OER) is implemented</li>
                <li>The PC contributes to the further development of the education by thinking along about new concepts at a high level and by assisting with the further content-related implementation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The TIW Study-program Committee currently has five teaching members, i.e., members of staff from subdepartments who contribute substantially to the education of students, and five student members nominated by the Intermate study association. The Education Officer from Intermate is a member of the Study-program Committee and therefore also has the right to vote. The chairman of the TIW Study-program Committee is not a member of the Study-program Committee and therefore cannot vote. Teaching members can serve on the committee for two years; for student members it is one year. The Study-program Committee also has a number of members with an advisory capacity: the study-program managers.</p>
