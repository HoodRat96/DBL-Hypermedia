        <h1>Major Computer Science and Engineering</h1>
        &nbsp;
        <p>The Majors Software Science and Web Science are formally embedded in the Bachelor program Computer Science and Engineering (in Dutch: Technische Informatica). Consequently, after completing one of these Majors, you will receive the Bachelor's degree certificate in Computer Science and Engineering. </p>
        <h4>Program Objectives</h4>
        <p>The overall objective of the Bachelor program is to train and educate young professionals who are able to progress into an appropriate Master’s program and/or are prepared to embark upon a professional career in the field of Software Science or Web Science.<br> Students are therefore expected to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>acquire cognitive skills relating to computer science and engineering</li>
            <li>acquire practical capabilities and skills relating to software design (the Web Science major focuses on complex internet-based applications, while the Software Science major is more concerned with technical applications)</li>
            <li>acquire professional and generic academic skills</li>
        </ol>
